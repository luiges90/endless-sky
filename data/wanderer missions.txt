They come swooping down from the sky, circle your ship to inspect it, and then land near the hatch and wait for you to open it. They do not appear to be armed, but their talons are three or four inches long.`

You shake your head to indicate that you do not understand, and again try to speak to it in your own language. Again it leans forward as if deeply focused on what you are saying.`
			`	The other aliens standing beside it are inspecting you with equal curiosity. Finally, one of them says to the leader, "Ek kalek kiro suk i'hai, sek speru siyek ka'hai esek'ru fer'ek." The leader gestures in response, turning up open palms, and the second alien steps forward and addresses you in an entirely different language, one that does not sound like birdsong at all. In fact, you suspect that it is the language of a different species entirely, but unfortunately it is no more comprehensible to you than the bird's own language.`
			`	They make some further attempts to communicate with you, but without success. Eventually they give up and all but the leader leaves. The leader makes a sweeping gesture to the rest of the spaceport, apparently inviting you to explore.`

			`	"Iy, ka'hai!" says the alien, rustling its wings in what you take as a gesture of excitement, "Speru ek ka'hai?" At the same time, though, one of the other aliens takes a step back and flexes its talons at you. It occurs to you that the Hai may or may not be viewed favorably here.`

They immediately direct you to a private government hangar, where a diplomat meets you. She holds out a paw to greet you, and says, "My name is Sayari.
